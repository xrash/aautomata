# Adaptive Automata

This is an implementation of an adaptive automaton written in Go (golang).

The adaptive capabilities present in this kind of automata enables it to recognize context-sensitive languages. However, the result may be rather complex due to the various adaptive functions that can be present in automata that model such problems.

This implementation was mostly inspired by [João José Neto's thesis](http://www.pcs.usp.br/~lta/artigos/neto_tese.pdf) (portuguese).
